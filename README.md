# Book-Inventory-System-

- Designed and coded the frontend using Python (used Tkinter packages) to create different widgets relevant to having a book inventory system
- Used SQLite to build the backend, and created multiple tables to make sure the database was normalized
- Connected the backend and frontend using python and turned the application into a .exe application at the end
